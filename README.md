# Object Tracking Research and Experiment Proposal
**Your Name:** Xiuyi Qian

## Project Title
Object Tracking in Multiple Scenarios
**Advancements in Object Tracking: A Comprehensive Study**

## Project Overview

Object tracking is a fundamental component of various applications, such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, and robotics. It plays a crucial role in enabling these systems to interpret and interact with their environments effectively. However, there are ongoing challenges in object tracking, including issues related to occlusion, scale variation, non-rigid objects, and real-time processing constraints.

The goal of this research and experimentation project is to address these challenges by developing innovative object-tracking techniques that enhance tracking accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. The project will consist of the following key components:

1. **Paper Review:** A comprehensive review of the existing literature on object tracking to identify gaps, trends, and emerging techniques. This will serve as the foundation for our research.

2. **Data Collection:** The acquisition of diverse datasets, including real-world scenarios and challenging conditions, to evaluate the performance of different tracking algorithms rigorously.

3. **Algorithm Development:** The design and implementation of novel object tracking algorithms that address issues like occlusion, non-rigid objects...

4. **Experimental Evaluation:** Extensive experimentation and benchmarking of the developed algorithms using the collected datasets to assess their performance against existing methods.

5. **Performance Metrics:** The definition and application of appropriate evaluation metrics, such as tracking accuracy, robustness, speed, and computational efficiency, to measure the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

6. **Comparison with Baselines:** A comparative analysis of the new algorithms against existing state-of-the-art object tracking methods to highlight their advantages and limitations.

7. **Use OpenAI API:** Use OPENAI LLM to test their efficiency on input videos

## Expected Outcomes

1. The development of the object detection algorithm.

2. The development of advanced object-tracking algorithms that demonstrate improved performance in challenging real-world scenarios.

3. Derivative tasks like object Counting, general object classification

4. Comparison of application of the model in different sceneries.
